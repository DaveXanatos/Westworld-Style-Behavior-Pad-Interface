# Westworld-Style-Behavior-Pad-Interface
This is a working version of the iconic Behavior Pad "Rose Graph" Interface that the Westworld Techs use to set Host Behavioral Attributes.  It is written in HTML5 using Canvas, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.  It has only been tested in Chrome.  I have a copy running on an Apache server "in the wild" as well as a copy running on Raspberry Pi SBCs that serve as "Host Brains" in my robots.  Those Raspberries are running NGINX server and VSFTPC.  This project allows you to set and save host parameters (reads and writes text files to the server if you have R/W perms).  The parameters file (ATTRIBS.txt) allows you to fully customize the Attribute Names.  The system auto-scales to fit whatever screen size you are using, I've tested on my Android phone (LG V20) up to my 32" monitor.  Feel free to add, customize as you like, just please provide credit to me for the hard work I did to get it to this point, and will continue to do as I add more features.  The eventual goal is reproducing working functionality of all the Behavior Pad Screens we've seen in the awesome HBO series Westworld.
